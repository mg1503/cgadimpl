Problem
The backward loop was running infinitely and never completing.

Root Causes & Fixes
1. Race Condition in Counter Check ⭐ CRITICAL
Bug: if (parent->child_grad_count.fetch_sub(1) - 1 == 0)
Fix: if (parent->child_grad_count.fetch_sub(1) == 1)
Issue: fetch_sub(1) returns the old value, so old - 1 gave wrong result.

2. Main Thread Racing with Workers ⭐ CRITICAL
Bug: Main thread also tried to pop from queue, competing with worker threads
Fix: Main thread only waits for outstanding_tasks to reach 0
Issue: Multiple threads racing for few queue items caused deadlock when queue empty but tasks > 0.

3. Uninitialized finished Flag
Bug: bool finished; never initialized
Fix: Added constructor: 
readyqueue() : finished(false) {}

4. Only Root Node Initially Pushed
Bug: Only pushed root if ready
Fix: Push ALL nodes with child_grad_count == 0
Issue: Some initially-ready nodes weren't pushed, blocking computation.

5. Wrong Outstanding Tasks Count
Bug: Counted all nodes with 
requires_grad()

Fix: Only count !is_leaf && requires_grad() nodes
Issue: Leaf nodes don't execute VJP, so shouldn't be counted.

6. Missing Task Decrement on Checkpoint Failure
Bug: continue without decrementing when checkpoint fails
Fix: Added outstanding_tasks-- before continue

7. Missing VJP Execution in Original Main Thread Code
Bug: VJP only called inside checkpoint block
Fix: Separated checkpoint logic from VJP execution
Note: This bug was fixed but then main thread worker code was removed entirely.
